# News aggregator and reading list

Built from scratch in a 6 day long group project using:

* Vue.js
* Mongodb
* Node
* Express
* Trello board, Git

We opted for creating our own brief.

The news aggregator shows the most updated articles divided per category from the user selected source (The Guardian and The New York Times) and allows the user to select them and save them in a reading list collection.


Features includes:

* show the most updated articles divided per category
* select articles from two sources: The Guardian and The New York Times
* add multiple articles to a reading list
* remove articles from reading list
* read on our app or on the website
